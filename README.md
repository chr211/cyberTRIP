Cyber Triage &amp; Response Incident Platform. A comprehensive web-based tool designed to track, manage, and prioritize cyber security incidents in real-time and respond with integrated leading external cybersecurity APIs. New video walkthrough for AWS coming soon.

CyberTRIP, short for Cyber Triage & Response Incident Platform, is a comprehensive web-based
tool designed to simplify how cybersecurity incidents are tracked, managed, and prioritized in real-time.
Motivated by the need for an integrated environment in security operations centers, this project was
meant to simplify and optimize cybersecurity incident response. It stands out by integrating external
cybersecurity tools naturally into a single, user-friendly dashboard, offering not just real-time incident
tracking and management, but also the capability to add, save, search, and easily generate statistics on
incidents. It includes all the key features of an incident response tool, while avoiding any unnecessary or
distracting extras. The platform's ability to generate incident statistics to export data in formats like CSV
further extends its utility outside the tool.

The project was conceptualized to satisfy the needs of security operations center analysts, who
required a powerful yet intuitive tool to enhance their efficiency in responding to security incidents.
Many of these tools can be overwhelming and overly complex. The uniqueness of CyberTRIP lies in its
all-in-one solution approach, where different types of incident responses can be managed and accessed
via an integrated dashboard. This ensures that digital assets remain secure while significantly
streamlining the workflow for addressing cybersecurity incidents. CyberTRIP's design also reflects an
understanding of the complexity and uniqueness of cybersecurity incident response, which comes from
one of the team memberâ€™s cybersecurity internship experience. In their experience, they found that
integrated access to a variety of tools in one interface would be desirable. With this platform, we aim to
facilitate the most common workflows that not only address basic responses but also adapt to the
evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.
